# Reckoner-using-Kotlin
This is a basic Reckoner(calculator) app created after completing course provided by google in codelabs.
I developed a “10-key” Reckoner(calculator) on Android Studio using Kotlin. The buttons included should be:
Number Keys: “1”, “2”, “3”, “4”, “5”, “6”, “7”, “8”, “9”, “0”.
Operation Keys: “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”
Other Keys: “=”, “CLEAR”. Here the “CLEAR” key should clear out the screen and everything in the memory. The “=” key should apply the operation and give the result.
Additional the calculator will have a “DEL” key which is the same as the “backspace” and will remove the last character on the screen.
A “.” key should show a decimal.
steps used:
1.create empty project
2.Adding colors to the colors.xml file
3.Modifying the styles.xml file
4.Adding additional size and format chnages in activity_main.xml
5.Placing Expression builder compile ‘net.objecthunter:exp4j:0.4.8’ inside build gradle
6.Writing code in kotlin using three concepts 1.Functions 2.Overriding of functions 3.Calling Buttons using SetonclickListener
7.run app using emulator or mobile,
